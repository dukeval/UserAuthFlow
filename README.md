# UserAuthFlow

Angular User Auth Flow
* Develop a Login Component and user dashboard component
* Use a service and dependency injection to read and write (temp persistence) a list of users
* Set up routing between 3 Components (i.e. after a user logs in, they see their user dashboard)
* Don't have to be a real user auth flow; use temporary variables
